# Computer Networking Basics

## Transport Protocols

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented transport
protocol. It provides reliable and ordered delivery of data between
applications. TCP uses acknowledgements, retransmissions, and flow
control to ensure reliable communication.

UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless transport protocol.
It does not guarantee delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection.
UDP is commonly used for latency-sensitive applications such as
streaming, DNS, and online gaming.

## Application Protocols

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an application layer protocol
used for communication between web clients and web servers. HTTP
typically runs over TCP because reliable and ordered delivery is
required for web content.

DNS (Domain Name System) translates domain names into IP addresses.
Most DNS queries use UDP because the request and response messages
are typically small and low latency is preferred. TCP may be used
for large DNS responses or zone transfers.

## Reliable Communication

Reliable communication ensures that transmitted data arrives at the
destination without loss, duplication, or reordering. TCP achieves
this through acknowledgements, sequence numbers, retransmissions,
and congestion control.
